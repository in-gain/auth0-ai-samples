# Auth for Generative AI Applications

Sample applications showcasing [Auth0's](https://www.auth0.ai/) authentication and authorization capabilities in the context of generative AI applications.

You can find a [hosted demo here](https://demo.auth0.ai/).

Samples are organized as below:

- [**authenticate-users**](https://auth0.com/ai/docs/user-authentication): Easily implement login experiences, tailor made for AI agents. Whether for chatbots or background agents.
- [**call-apis-on-users-behalf**](https://auth0.com/ai/docs/call-others-apis-on-users-behalf): Use secure standards to get API tokens for Google, Github and more. Seamlessly integrate your app with other products.
- [**authorization-for-rag**](https://auth0.com/ai/docs/authorization-for-rag): Only retrieve documents users have access to. Avoid leaking data to a user that should not have access to it.
- [**asynchronous-authorization**](https://auth0.com/ai/docs/async-authorization): Let your autonomous, async agents do work in the background. Use Async Auth to request approval when needed.

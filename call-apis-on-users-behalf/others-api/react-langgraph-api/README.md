# React.js Single Page Application with LangGraph API, Auth0 AI, AI SDK, and Token Vault

This example demonstrates a **Memory Agent** chat application built with [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) that integrates [Auth0 AI](https://auth0.ai) for authentication and third-party API access through Token Vault. The agent maintains conversation history, remembers user preferences, and can access external APIs like Google Calendar on behalf of authenticated users.

This project was generated using the public [`langchain-ai/create-agent-chat-app`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/create-agent-chat-app) generator and enhanced with Auth0 authentication and Token Vault integration for secure third-party API access.

## What is the Memory Agent?

The Memory Agent is an intelligent conversational assistant that:

- **Remembers conversations**: Stores and retrieves user interactions and preferences across sessions
- **Learns about users**: Builds a knowledge base about user preferences, habits, and context
- **Accesses external APIs**: Integrates with third-party services like Google Calendar using secure token exchange
- **Maintains context**: Uses stored memories to provide personalized responses and recommendations

The agent can help with tasks like:
- Scheduling and calendar management
- Remembering personal preferences and past conversations
- Providing contextual recommendations based on user history
- Coordinating with external services while maintaining security

## Authentication & Token Exchange Flow

This application implements Auth0's Token Vault for secure third-party API access:

![Access Token Exchange Flow](./public/langgraph-access-token-exchange-token-vault.png)

Auth0's Token Vault enables the LangGraph API to exchange a SPA's access token for third-party API access tokens. This approach addresses a key security challenge for applications that cannot securely store refresh tokens. The flow works by having the React client send its access token to the LangGraph API, which then performs the token exchange using Resource Server Client credentials.

**Key Benefits:**
- **No x-api-key required**: Auth0 serves as the identity provider instead of API keys
- **Secure token management**: Token Vault handles refresh tokens and credential storage
- **Third-party API access**: Seamless integration with external APIs like Google Calendar
- **Platform flexibility**: Works with both self-hosted and LangGraph Platform deployments

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or later
- npm 7 or later (for workspace support)
- An [OpenAI key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries#create-and-export-an-api-key) or [Anthropic key](https://console.anthropic.com/) for the LLM
- Google Cloud Project with Calendar API enabled (for calendar integration)

### 1. Auth0 Configuration

1. **Create an Auth0 Application** (Single Page Application):
   - Go to your [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/)
   - Create a new **Single Page Application**
   - Configure the following settings:
     - **Allowed Callback URLs**: `http://localhost:5173`
     - **Allowed Logout URLs**: `http://localhost:5173`
     - **Allowed Web Origins**: `http://localhost:5173`
     - Enable "Allow Refresh Token" in Grant Types under Advanced Settings

2. **Create an Auth0 API**:
   - In your Auth0 Dashboard, go to APIs
   - Create a new API with an identifier (audience)
   - Enable "Allow Offline Access" in Access Settings
   - Note down the API identifier for your environment variables

3. **Create a Custom API Client** (for Token Vault Token Exchange):
   - The Custom API Client allows your API server to perform token exchanges using **access tokens** instead of **refresh tokens**. This client enables Token Vault to exchange an access token for an external API access token (e.g., Google Calendar API).
   - Setup steps:
      - Go to the API you created in Step #2 and click the **Add Application** button in the right top corner.
      - After that click the **Configure Application** button in the right top corner.
      - Note down the <code>client id</code> and <code>client secret</code> for your environment variables.

4. **Configure a Social Connection for Google in Auth0**:
   - Make sure to enable all `Calendar` scopes from the Permissions options
   - Make sure to enable Token Vault for the Connection under the Advanced Settings
   - Make sure to enable the connection for your SPA Application created in Step 1 and the Resource Server Client created in Step 3
   - Test the connection in Auth0 "Try Connection" screen and make sure connection is working & configured correctly
   - Enable Token Vault for the connection under Advanced Settings

### 2. Environment Variables

#### Agents (.env)
Copy `apps/agents/.env.example` to `apps/agents/.env`:

```bash
# LangSmith (optional)
# LANGSMITH_API_KEY=""
# LANGSMITH_TRACING_V2="true"
# LANGSMITH_PROJECT="default"

# LLM Provider (choose one)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key

# Auth0 Configuration
AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-auth0-domain.auth0.com
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=your-api-identifier
AUTH0_CUSTOM_API_CLIENT_ID=your-custom-api-client-id
AUTH0_CUSTOM_API_CLIENT_SECRET=your-custom-api-client-secret

# Development only (not for production)
NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0
```

```bash
VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-auth0-domain.auth0.com
VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-spa-client-id
VITE_AUTH0_AUDIENCE=your-api-identifier
VITE_LANGGRAPH_API_URL=http://localhost:2024
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install all dependencies from the project root
npm install
```

### 4. Run the Application

#### Start both services in development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- **LangGraph API**: `http://localhost:2024` (agents backend)
- **React App**: `http://localhost:5173` (web frontend)

Or run them individually:
```bash
npm run dev --workspace=apps/agents  # Run LangGraph API
npm run dev --workspace=apps/web     # Run React frontend
```

## Authentication Architecture

### Custom Auth Handler

The LangGraph API uses a custom authentication handler that validates Auth0 JWT tokens:

```typescript
// apps/agents/src/auth.ts
auth.authenticate(async (request: Request) => {
  // Handles both Authorization header (local dev) and x-api-key header (LangGraph Platform)
  const token = xApiKeyHeader ?? authHeader;
  
  // Verify JWT using Auth0 JWKS
  const { payload } = await jwtVerify(token, JWKS, {
    issuer: `https://${AUTH0_DOMAIN}/`,
    audience: AUTH0_AUDIENCE,
  });
  
  return {
    identity: payload.sub!,
    auth_type: "auth0",
    _credentials: { accessToken: token }
  };
});
```

### Token Vault Integration

The agents use Auth0 AI's Token Vault for secure third-party API access:

```typescript
// apps/agents/src/auth0-ai.ts
const auth0AI = new Auth0AI({
  auth0: {
    domain: process.env.AUTH0_DOMAIN!,
    clientId: process.env.AUTH0_CUSTOM_API_CLIENT_ID!,
    clientSecret: process.env.AUTH0_CUSTOM_API_CLIENT_SECRET!,
  },
});

export const withGoogleCalendar = auth0AI.withTokenForConnection({
  connection: "google-oauth2",
  scopes: ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.freebusy"],
  accessToken: async (_, config) => {
    return config.configurable?.langgraph_auth_user?._credentials?.accessToken;
  },
  subjectTokenType: SUBJECT_TOKEN_TYPES.SUBJECT_TYPE_ACCESS_TOKEN,
});
```

## API Endpoints

The LangGraph API provides the following endpoints:

- **POST /runs/stream**: Stream agent conversations with authentication
- **GET /threads/{thread_id}/state**: Get conversation state and memory
- **POST /threads/{thread_id}/runs**: Start new conversation runs

All endpoints require valid Auth0 JWT tokens in the `Authorization` header.

## Key Features
